## Project Description

The Stock Market Simulator is a console-based project written in C that simulates a simplified stock market environment. This application allows users to experience the dynamics of buying and selling stocks, tracking stock prices, and managing their virtual portfolios. By providing a risk-free simulation, users can explore investment strategies, observe market fluctuations, and improve their understanding of stock trading.

3. *Interactive Interface:* Offer users an interactive console-based interface for buying, selling, and managing virtual stocks.

4. *Portfolio Management:* Allow users to manage their virtual portfolios, track their virtual balance, and monitor stocks they own.
